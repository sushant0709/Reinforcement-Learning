# Reinforcement-Learning Based Project

## Project Overview:
This project is based on Reinforcement Learning.It involves an Agent which learns how to play MountainCar-v0 game(from Gym environment) using Deep-Q-Learning.The project is first implemented using hard-coded strategy and then RL based strategy is applied, in which the Agent learns the Q-function with the help of a Neural Network.
